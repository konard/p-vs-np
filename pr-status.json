{"body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR formalizes the InfoTechnology Center's 2012 P≠NP proof attempt by Junichiro Fukuyama in Coq, Lean, and Isabelle. The formalization demonstrates where the proof breaks down and provides educational value for understanding common pitfalls in complexity theory proofs.\n\n## Issue Reference\n\nFixes #85  \nPart of #44 (Test all P vs NP attempts formally)\n\n## Background\n\nIn summer 2012, Junichiro Fukuyama from Toyota InfoTechnology Center published a proof attempt claiming P ≠ NP using:\n- Topological properties of Hamming space (2^[n])\n- A generalized sunflower lemma\n- Circuit complexity arguments for the clique problem\n\nThe paper was submitted to arXiv (arXiv:1305.3218) in May 2013 but was **withdrawn on October 21, 2013** after the author discovered a critical error.\n\n## The Error\n\n**Lemma 5.3** contained a fundamental flaw:\n- The lemma claimed a property about function f(σ) that implicitly assumed it was independent of parameter z\n- In reality, f(σ,z) fundamentally depends on z\n- This unaccounted dependency invalidated the entire proof chain leading to P ≠ NP\n\nThe author's withdrawal notice stated: *\"Due to the dependence of f(σ) on z, Lemma 5.3 is incorrect\"*\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Files Added\n\n```\nproofs/attempts/infotechnology-center-2012-pneqnp/\n├── README.md                          # Comprehensive documentation\n├── coq/FukuyamaAttempt.v             # Coq formalization (276 lines)\n├── lean/FukuyamaAttempt.lean         # Lean 4 formalization (245 lines)\n└── isabelle/FukuyamaAttempt.thy      # Isabelle/HOL formalization (269 lines)\n```\n\n### Formalization Structure\n\nEach formalization includes:\n\n1. **Basic Definitions**: Complexity classes (P, NP), graph theory (clique problem), Boolean circuits, monotone circuits\n2. **Mathematical Framework**: Hamming spaces, sunflower lemma (Erdős-Rado)\n3. **Fukuyama's Construction**: Function f(σ,z) with explicit type signatures showing the z dependency\n4. **Error Demonstration**: \n   - Lemma 5.3 (incorrect version) - assumes f(σ) independent of z\n   - Proof that this contradicts the actual dependency on z\n   - Shows why the corrected version is trivial and doesn't support the main claim\n5. **Impact Analysis**: Demonstrates why the incorrect lemma invalidates the P ≠ NP conclusion\n\n### Key Theorems\n\nAll three proof assistants verify:\n\n- **`lemma_5_3_is_false`**: Proves the incorrect version of Lemma 5.3 is false given that f depends on z\n- **`lemma_5_3_corrected_trivial`**: Shows the corrected version is trivial and useless\n- **`fukuyama_attempt_fails`**: Demonstrates the entire proof attempt fails due to this error\n\n## Educational Value\n\nThis formalization demonstrates:\n\n1. **Hidden Dependencies**: How subtle dependencies in mathematical arguments can be overlooked in informal proofs\n2. **Value of Type Systems**: Formal proof assistants would catch this error during type-checking since f's dependency on z would be explicit in the function signature\n3. **Common Pitfalls**: Circuit complexity lower bounds are extraordinarily difficult with many subtle traps\n4. **Verification Importance**: Even papers submitted to arXiv can contain fundamental errors that formal verification would catch\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ All Coq definitions and proofs type-check\n- ✅ All Lean definitions and proofs compile\n- ✅ All Isabelle theories verify\n- ✅ Updated ROOT file to include new Isabelle theory\n- ✅ Updated Main.lean to import new module\n- ✅ CI workflows will automatically verify all formalizations\n\n## References\n\n- **arXiv**:

(content moved)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe comprehensive README.md includes:\n- Full description of the proof attempt\n- Detailed analysis of the error in Lemma 5.3\n- Why this error matters for complexity theory\n- Lessons for formal verification\n- Complete references and citations\n\n---\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude
