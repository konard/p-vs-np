{"body":"# Formalize: InfoTechnology Center (2012) - P≠NP\n\n**Attempt ID**: 87\n**Author**: InfoTechnology Center\n**Year**: 2012\n**Claim**: P≠NP\n**Folder**: `proofs/attempts/infotechnology-center-2012-pneqnp/`\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summer 2012, Junichiro Fukuyama from the Toyota InfoTechnology Center proved that P is not equal to NP. The proof explores topological properties of a Hamming space, generalizes the sunflower lemma, and builds on circuit theory. The paper \"Computing Cliques is Intractable\" is available at https://junfukuyama.wordpress.com/ . In May 2013, the author made his proof also available on the ArXive, at http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3218 . (Thanks to Uri Segal and Maris Ozols for providing these links.)\n\n## Task\n\nFormalize this P vs NP proof attempt in Coq, Lean, and Isabelle until the error is found.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Create folder structure: `proofs/attempts/infotechnology-center-2012-pneqnp/`\n2. Create detailed README.md with:\n   - Full description of the attempt\n   - The main argument/approach\n   - Known refutation (if any)\n   - The error in the proof\n3. Write formal proofs in each system:\n   - `coq/` - Coq formalization\n   - `lean/` - Lean formalization\n   - `isabelle/` - Isabelle formalization\n4. Continue formalizing until the error/gap is identified\n5. Document the findings\n\n## Source\n\n- Woeginger's list: https://wscor.win.tue.nl/woeginger/P-versus-NP.htm (Entry #87)\n\n## Parent Issue\n\nPart of #44 - Test all P vs NP attempts formally\n\n---\n\n*Auto-generated from issue #45*\n","comments":[],"title":"Formalize: InfoTechnology Center (2012) - P≠NP"}
