## Note

The paper itself is complete gibberish, as explicitly stated by the author. It was posted as an April Fool's Day joke to satirize flawed P vs NP proof attempts.

According to Zeilberger, "the 'proof' itself is complete gibberish (and of course, intentionally so)."

## How to Obtain

The paper is publicly available at the URL above. It is approximately 5-6 pages long and describes a fictional polynomial-time algorithm for the Subset Sum problem using integral evaluation and linear programming.

## Abstract (Paraphrased from Joke Paper)

The paper claims to prove P=NP by providing a polynomial-time algorithm for the Subset Sum problem. The approach allegedly involves translating Subset Sum into integral evaluation, using rigorous interval analysis (not floating-point computation), and solving over 10,000 linear programming problems with 100,000+ variables each.

This is all intentional nonsense meant to parody common mistakes in failed P vs NP attempts.
