---

## Metadata

- **Attempt ID**: 13 (from Woeginger's list, as of January 2026)
- **Author**: Mikhail N. Kupchik
- **Year**: 2004 (Spring)
- **Claim**: P ≠ NP
- **Status**: Inaccessible - Original sources no longer available
- **Affiliation**: 3rd year undergraduate, Department of Applied Mathematics, University of KPI, Kiev, Ukraine

## Overview

In spring 2004, Mikhail N. Kupchik started a series of papers that aimed at proving "P-not-equal-to-NP". The papers in this series were all titled "P versus NP problem solution".

## Source Material

### Original Papers (Currently Inaccessible)

The proof attempt was originally published as three PDF files:

1. `pvsnp_en.pdf` - http://users.i.com.ua/~zkup/pvsnp_en.pdf (dead link)
2. `pvsnp_en_001.pdf` - http://users.i.com.ua/~zkup/pvsnp_en_001.pdf (dead link)
3. `pvsnp_en_002.pdf` - http://users.i.com.ua/~zkup/pvsnp_en_002.pdf (dead link)

**Note**: As of October 2025, the original domain (users.i.com.ua) is no longer accessible, and no archived versions of these PDFs could be located via Internet Archive or other archival services.

### References

## Proof Strategy

**Unknown** - Due to the inaccessibility of the source materials, the specific proof approach, mathematical argument, and claimed methodology cannot be determined at this time.

## Known Issues / Refutation

**Unknown** - Without access to the original papers:
- The specific error or gap in the proof cannot be identified
- The proof technique used is unknown
- Whether the proof faced any formal refutation is undocumented

## Formalization Approach

Since the original proof documents are inaccessible, this formalization provides:

1. **Placeholder Framework**: A basic structure that could be used to formalize the proof once the source materials become available
2. **Generic P ≠ NP Test Framework**: Implements the four standard test methods that any P ≠ NP proof must satisfy
3. **Documentation**: Records the historical attempt for completeness of the P vs NP attempts catalog

### What This Formalization Provides

- **Coq Implementation** (`coq/Kupchik2004PNotEqualNP.v`): Basic placeholder structure
- **Lean Implementation** (`lean/Kupchik2004PNotEqualNP.lean`): Basic placeholder structure
- **Isabelle Implementation** (`isabelle/Kupchik2004PNotEqualNP.thy`): Basic placeholder structure

Each formalization includes:
- Standard complexity theory definitions (P, NP, polynomial time, etc.)
- The four test methods for P ≠ NP proofs
- Placeholder axioms representing where Kupchik's specific claims would be formalized
- Documentation noting the unavailability of source materials

## Future Work

This formalization can be completed if:

1. The original PDF files are recovered (via author contact, archival discovery, etc.)
2. Alternative documentation of Kupchik's proof approach becomes available
3. Someone with knowledge of the proof content provides details

## How to Use This Formalization

Since the actual proof content is unavailable, this serves as a **template** demonstrating:

- The structure for formalizing historical P vs NP attempts
- The verification framework that would be applied
- Proper documentation when source materials are inaccessible

### Verification Status

- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ Placeholder formalizations provided
- ❌ Actual proof content unavailable
- ❌ Specific error identification not possible
- ❌ Complete formalization pending source material recovery

## Contributing

If you have access to Kupchik's original papers or knowledge of the proof approach:

1. Contact the repository maintainers
2. Provide the source materials or detailed description
3. Help complete the formalization with the actual proof content

| Proof Description | ⚠️ Unknown |
| Error Identification | ⚠️ Unknown |
| Coq Formalization | ⚠️ Placeholder only |
| Lean Formalization | ⚠️ Placeholder only |

**Note on Woeginger's List Numbering**: This attempt was originally listed as entry #10 in Woeginger's P vs NP page, but the list was later renumbered and as of January 2026, Mikhail N. Kupchik's attempt is entry #13. The folder was renamed from `author10-2004-pneqnp` to `mikhail-kupchik-2004-pneqnp` to reflect the author's name and updated entry number.
