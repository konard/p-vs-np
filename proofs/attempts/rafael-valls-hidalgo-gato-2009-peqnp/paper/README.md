## 1985 Original Work

**Title**: Método de solución para sistemas de ecuaciones simultáneas sobre un Campo de Galois y aplicaciones en Inteligencia Artificial
**Translation**: Solution method for systems of simultaneous equations over a Galois Field and applications in Artificial Intelligence
**Author**: Rafael Valls Hidalgo-Gato
**Published in**: Proceedings of ININTEF (Institute of Fundamental Technical Research, Cuban Academy of Science) Scientific Conference
**Citation**: 1985 Annual Report, Vol.II, S2-25, p.274
**Location**: Havana, Cuba
**Year**: 1985
**Availability**: Limited - Cuban institutional archives only

According to the 2009 announcement, this 1985 paper reportedly contained "a polynomial-time algorithm" that resolved an NP-complete problem, which the author claimed proved P=NP.
