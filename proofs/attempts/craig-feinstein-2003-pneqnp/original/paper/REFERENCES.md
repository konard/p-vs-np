## Original Papers

### Primary P vs NP Papers (2003-04)

**Note**: These papers were submitted to arXiv but were subsequently withdrawn by the author after a counterexample was discovered. They may not be publicly accessible in their original form.

1. **"Evidence that P is not equal to NP"** (2003)
   - Author: Craig Alan Feinstein
   - Year: 2003
   - Status: Withdrawn
   - Description: This paper claimed to provide evidence (rather than a complete proof) that P ≠ NP within a restricted model of computation.

2. **"P is not equal to NP"** (2003-04)
   - Author: Craig Alan Feinstein
   - Year: 2003-04
   - Status: Withdrawn after counterexample discovered
   - Description: A stronger claim that was subsequently retracted when a counterexample to the main argument was found.

### Related Papers by Feinstein (Same Period)

These papers from the same time period show Feinstein's broader interest in unprovability claims:

3. **"The Riemann Hypothesis is Unprovable"**
   - arXiv: [math/0309367](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309367)
   - Submitted: September 23, 2003
   - Last revised: November 23, 2011
   - Abstract: Claims to give "a simple proof that the Riemann Hypothesis is unprovable in any reasonable axiom system."

4. **"The Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture is Unprovable"**
   - arXiv: [math/0312309](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312309)
   - Submitted: December 15, 2003
   - Last revised: May 12, 2011
   - Abstract: Argues that "any proof of the Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture must have an infinite number of lines; therefore, no formal proof is possible."
   - Published in: Global Journal of Science Frontier Research

5. **"Complexity Science for Simpletons" / "An Elegant Argument that P is not NP"**
   - arXiv: [cs/0507008](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507008)
   - Year: 2005-06
   - Status: Different approach using "Mabel-Mildred-Feinstein" computational model
   - Note: This is formalized separately in `proofs/attempts/alan-feinstein-2005-pneqnp/`

## Secondary Sources

### Woeginger's P vs NP List

6. **"The P-versus-NP page"**
   - Author: Gerhard J. Woeginger
   - URL: https://wscor.win.tue.nl/woeginger/P-versus-NP.htm
   - Entry: #11 (Craig Alan Feinstein, 2003-04, P≠NP)
   - Description: Comprehensive catalog of claimed proofs of P vs NP

### Background on Restricted Computational Models

7. **"Lower Bounds for Restricted Models of Computation"**
   - Various authors in complexity theory literature
   - Topics: Decision trees, circuit complexity, communication complexity
   - Relevance: Explains why lower bounds in restricted models don't necessarily transfer to general computation

8. **"Barriers in Computational Complexity"**
   - Relevant papers on relativization, natural proofs, and algebrization
   - Shows why certain proof techniques cannot resolve P vs NP
   - Key insight: Restricted model arguments often run into these barriers

## Accessing the Papers

### Available Papers

- The Riemann Hypothesis paper: Available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309367
- The Collatz Conjecture paper: Available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0312309

### Withdrawn Papers

The original P vs NP papers from 2003-04 were withdrawn and may not be publicly accessible. Our formalization is based on:
1. The description in Woeginger's list
2. Common patterns in restricted model approaches
3. General knowledge of typical errors in such arguments
