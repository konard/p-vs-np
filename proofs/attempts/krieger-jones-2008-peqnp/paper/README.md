## Abstract (from patent application)

The patent application claims a polynomial-time method for detecting whether a Hamiltonian circuit exists in an undirected graph. The application states that since the Hamiltonian circuit problem is NP-complete, a polynomial-time solution would prove P = NP.

## Important Note on Patent vs. Peer-Reviewed Publication

This attempt is documented only in a patent application, not in peer-reviewed academic literature. Key differences:

1. **Patent Review Process**:
   - Patents are reviewed by patent examiners for legal requirements (novelty, non-obviousness, utility)
   - Patent examiners are not required to verify complex mathematical proofs
   - Focus is on legal/practical aspects, not mathematical rigor

2. **Academic Peer Review**:
   - Academic papers undergo peer review by domain experts
   - Reviewers check mathematical correctness and rigor
   - Major claims (like P = NP) would receive intense scrutiny from theoretical computer scientists

3. **Why This Matters**:
   - Many patents contain unverified or incorrect mathematical claims
   - Patent grants do not constitute mathematical validation
   - The P vs NP problem requires mathematical proof, not legal documentation

## Academic Response

To our knowledge:
- No peer-reviewed publication has validated this claim
- No major computer science conference or journal has accepted this work
- The theoretical computer science community has not recognized this as a valid proof
- The P vs NP problem remains officially unsolved
- The Clay Mathematics Institute's $1 million prize remains unclaimed

## Related Documentation

- **Woeginger's List**: Entry #42 at https://wscor.win.tue.nl/woeginger/P-versus-NP.htm
- Lists this as one of many claimed proofs of P = NP
- No indication that the claim has been validated

## Note on Availability

Patent applications are public documents and freely accessible. However, the mathematical content should be evaluated with appropriate skepticism given:
- Lack of peer review by complexity theorists
- Absence of validation by the theoretical computer science community
- The continued open status of the P vs NP problem
- The difference between patent examination and mathematical proof verification
