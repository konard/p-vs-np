## Note

This paper was never accepted for peer-reviewed publication and remains only on arXiv. The computational complexity community has widely rejected the claims as based on fundamental misunderstandings of computational complexity theory and the nature of logical paradoxes.

The paper can be downloaded from arXiv for historical and educational purposes to understand common errors in failed P vs NP attempts.
