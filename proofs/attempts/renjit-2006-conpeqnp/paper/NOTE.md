# Paper Status

## Original Paper

**Title**: coNP Is Equal To NP
**Author**: Raju Renjit G
**ArXiv**: [cs.CC/0611147](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0611147)
**Status**: **WITHDRAWN by author**

## Timeline

- **November 29, 2006**: Initial submission (v1)
- **2006-2009**: Nine revisions published (v1 through v8)
- **August 25, 2009**: Paper withdrawn by author

## Current Availability

The paper was withdrawn by the author and is **no longer available** for download from arXiv. The abstract on the arXiv page states: "This submission has been withdrawn at the request of the author."

## What We Know

From the available metadata:

- **Title**: "coNP Is Equal To NP"
- **Field**: Computational Complexity (cs.CC)
- **Length**: 24 pages (v1)
- **Abstract** (v1): Claimed to prove co-NP = NP using a general result applied to the clique problem
- **ACM Classification**: F.1.3 (Complexity Measures and Classes)

## Significance of Withdrawal

The withdrawal after **9 revision attempts** over nearly **3 years** strongly suggests:

1. The author discovered a fundamental flaw in the proof
2. The flaw was not repairable through revisions
3. The author demonstrated scientific integrity by withdrawing rather than leaving a flawed proof online

## Related Work

This was the author's second major complexity theory paper:

1. **2005**: "Fixed Type Theorems" (arXiv:cs/0502030) - claimed P ≠ NP - also withdrawn
2. **2006**: This paper (arXiv:cs.CC/0611147) - claimed co-NP = NP - also withdrawn

Both papers focused on the clique problem and both were ultimately withdrawn.

## Our Formalization

Since the full paper text is unavailable, our formalization:

- Documents the **claim** (co-NP = NP)
- Explains the **significance** of such a result if true
- Identifies **common error patterns** in NP vs co-NP attempts
- Demonstrates the **challenges** inherent in proving such results
- Uses the clique problem as context (known from metadata)
- Notes the paper's **withdrawal** as evidence of fundamental flaws

This approach allows us to:
- Educate about the NP vs co-NP question
- Highlight typical pitfalls in complexity theory proofs
- Document a historical attempt and its outcome
- Provide context for future researchers

## Note for Researchers

If you have access to archived versions (v1-v8) of this paper and can provide additional details about the specific approach used, please consider contributing that information to improve this formalization.

The goal is educational: understanding why such proofs fail helps the community avoid similar mistakes and appreciate the genuine difficulty of these fundamental questions.
