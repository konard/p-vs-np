### Abstract

The paper argues that Gödel defined an arithmetical relation R(n) which can be "constructively computed as true for any given natural number n, but is not Turing-computable as true for any given natural number n." The author claims this implies "the current formulation of the PvNP problem admits a trivial logical solution that is not significant computationally," concluding that P ≠ NP.

### Key Concepts

- Distinction between constructive computability and Turing computability
- Application of Gödel's incompleteness theorems
- Formal logic approach to P vs NP
- Emphasis on verification vs decision
