        <div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
        <p>
            We consider an arithmetical relation R(n) which—when treated as a Boolean function—is
            constructively computable as true for any given natural number n, but which is not
            Turing-computable as true for any given natural number n.
        </p>
        <p>
            We argue that, since R(n) can be labelled as an NP language, this suggests that the
            current formulation of the PvNP problem admits a trivial logical solution that is not
            significant computationally.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">1. Introduction</div>
        <p>
            In this paper, we examine Gödel's construction in his seminal 1931 paper on formally
            undecidable propositions. We show that this construction defines an arithmetical relation
            that can be verified constructively for any specific natural number, but which cannot be
            decided algorithmically by a Turing machine.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">2. The Gödelian Relation</div>
        <p>
            Gödel defined an arithmetical relation R(n) such that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For any given natural number n, we can constructively verify whether R(n) holds</li>
            <li>There is no Turing machine that can compute R(n) for all n</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This demonstrates a distinction between constructive computability (verification) and
            Turing computability (algorithmic decision).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">3. The Analogy to P vs NP</div>
        <p>
            We observe that this distinction mirrors the relationship between NP (verification in
            polynomial time) and P (decision in polynomial time). The Gödelian relation R(n) can be
            viewed as demonstrating that verification and decision are fundamentally different
            computational tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since R(n) can be verified constructively but not decided algorithmically, and since
            this relation can be formulated as an NP problem, we suggest that this provides a logical
            solution to the P vs NP question.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">4. Conclusion</div>
        <p>
            We have shown that Gödel's incompleteness results imply a formal distinction between
            verification and decision. This distinction, when interpreted in the context of complexity
            theory, suggests that P ≠ NP in a formal logical sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we acknowledge that this solution is trivial in the sense that it does not
            provide computational insights into the complexity of specific NP problems, and is therefore
            not significant from a computational perspective.
