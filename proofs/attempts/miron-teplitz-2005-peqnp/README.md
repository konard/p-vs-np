# Miron Teplitz (2005) - P=NP Attempt

**Attempt ID**: 25 (from Woeginger's list)
**Author**: Miron Teplitz
**Year**: 2005
**Claim**: P = NP
**Status**: Source material unavailable

## Summary

In December 2005, Miron Teplitz claimed to prove P=NP. The paper titled "Sigma-notation and the equivalence of P and NP classes" was reportedly published in the Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences (JIOS), Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Croatia.

## Source Information

- **Journal**: Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences (JIOS)
- **Institution**: Faculty of Organization and Informatics, Croatia
- **Original URL**: http://www.tarusa.ru/~mit/ENG/sigma01_e.php (currently unavailable - returns 404)
- **Listed on**: Woeginger's P versus NP page (Entry #25)

## Current Status

### Source Material Availability

As of October 2025, the source material for this proof attempt is **not publicly accessible**:

1. **Original URL**: The link http://www.tarusa.ru/~mit/ENG/sigma01_e.php listed on Woeginger's page returns a 404 error
2. **Journal Archives**: Searches in JIOS archives (including the Croatian scientific journal portal HRČAK) have not located this specific publication
3. **Web Search**: Comprehensive web searches for "Miron Teplitz P=NP sigma-notation" have not returned relevant results

### Known Information

Based on Woeginger's list entry, the only available information about this attempt is:

- **Title**: "Sigma-notation and the equivalence of P and NP classes"
- **Publication Date**: December 2005
- **Journal**: JIOS (Journal of Information and Organizational Sciences)
- **Approach**: The title suggests the proof uses sigma-notation (likely Σ notation from complexity theory, related to complexity classes like Σ₁, Σ₂, etc., in the polynomial hierarchy)

## The Approach (Speculative)

Based solely on the title "Sigma-notation and the equivalence of P and NP classes," we can speculate that the approach may have involved:

1. **Sigma Notation**: In computational complexity, Σ (sigma) notation often refers to:
   - Σᵢᵖ classes in the polynomial hierarchy (where Σ₁ᵖ = NP)
   - Summation notation in complexity expressions
   - Existential quantifiers in logical formulations

2. **Possible Approach**: The author may have attempted to show equivalence between P and NP using:
   - Properties of the polynomial hierarchy collapse
   - Relationships between existential and universal quantification
   - Combinatorial or algebraic manipulations involving sigma notation

## Known Issues and Refutations

**Status**: No specific refutation is documented, as the paper itself is not publicly available.

Given that:
- P vs NP remains an open problem
- This claim has not been verified by the broader mathematical/CS community
- The source material is unavailable for review

We can reasonably conclude that this proof attempt contains an error or gap, though we cannot identify the specific flaw without access to the paper.

## Formalization Status

Due to the unavailability of the source material, we **cannot formalize** this specific proof attempt in detail. Instead, this directory contains:

### Placeholder Formalizations

1. **[coq/MironTeplitz2005.v](coq/MironTeplitz2005.v)** - Coq placeholder documenting the unavailability
2. **[lean/MironTeplitz2005.lean](lean/MironTeplitz2005.lean)** - Lean placeholder documenting the unavailability
3. **[isabelle/MironTeplitz2005.thy](isabelle/MironTeplitz2005.thy)** - Isabelle/HOL placeholder documenting the unavailability

Each formalization file:
- Documents the source unavailability
- Provides context about what would be formalized if the source were available
- Serves as a placeholder for future formalization if the paper becomes accessible

## Next Steps

To complete this formalization, one would need to:

1. **Locate the source paper** through:
   - Direct contact with the author (if contactable)
   - University or institutional libraries in Croatia
   - Archive.org or other web archives
   - JIOS journal archives (print editions from 2005)

2. **Analyze the proof** once obtained:
   - Identify the main argument and key steps
   - Determine the mathematical foundations used
   - Locate any errors, gaps, or invalid assumptions

3. **Formalize the attempt**:
   - Model the proof structure in Coq, Lean, and Isabelle
   - Continue formalization until the error is revealed
   - Document the specific flaw in the argument

## Notes

This attempt is catalogued as part of the comprehensive effort to formally verify all known P vs NP proof attempts. While we cannot complete the full formalization without access to the source material, documenting the attempt and its current unavailability is still valuable for:

1. Maintaining a complete record of known attempts
2. Tracking which attempts have been analyzed
3. Identifying gaps in available literature
4. Potentially prompting others who may have access to share the material
